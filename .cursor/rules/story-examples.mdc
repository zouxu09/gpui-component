### Story and Example Conventions

- Stories live alongside components, e.g., [crates/story/src/button_story.rs](mdc:crates/story/src/button_story.rs), and should compile quickly; keep dependencies minimal.
- Runnable examples live in `crates/story/examples/` (e.g., [crates/story/examples/tiles.rs](mdc:crates/story/examples/tiles.rs)) and can be launched with `cargo run -p story --example <name>`.
- Prefer deterministic data (fixed seeds, fixtures such as [crates/story/src/fixtures/countries.json](mdc:crates/story/src/fixtures/countries.json)) to keep demos stable.
- Showcase both typical usage and edge cases (empty states, loading states, error states).
- Reuse shared assets from [assets/](mdc:assets/) and helper loaders in [crates/story/src/assets.rs](mdc:crates/story/src/assets.rs).
