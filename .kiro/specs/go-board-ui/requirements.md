# Go Board UI Widget Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for creating a reusable Go board UI widget component in the GPUI component library, inspired by the proven Shudan architecture from SabakiHQ. The focus is purely on the visual presentation, user interaction, and customization aspects of the board widget, without implementing game logic or Go-specific rules. This widget should provide the same level of flexibility and features as Shudan while leveraging GPUI's performance advantages for native applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a configurable Go board widget with customizable size and flexible board range support, so that I can create partial boards and adapt to different display requirements like Shudan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the widget THEN it SHALL accept vertex size parameter to control the overall board scale
2. WHEN range restrictions are applied THEN the widget SHALL support rangeX and rangeY parameters to display partial boards
3. WHEN board size changes THEN the widget SHALL automatically adjust grid lines and star point (hoshi) positions
4. WHEN styling the board THEN it SHALL support custom CSS properties for background, grid lines, borders, and coordinate colors
5. IF bounded sizing is needed THEN the widget SHALL support maxWidth/maxHeight constraints with automatic vertex size calculation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the board widget to handle stone display with realistic rendering and fuzzy placement like Shudan, so that I can create natural-looking Go boards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stones are displayed THEN the widget SHALL support signMap representation with -1 (white), 0 (empty), 1 (black) values
2. WHEN fuzzy placement is enabled THEN stones SHALL render slightly off-grid for natural appearance
3. WHEN stone animations are enabled THEN placement SHALL include slide-in animations with duration control
4. WHEN multiple stone types are used THEN the widget SHALL support random visual variation using rotation and texture classes
5. IF custom stone images are provided THEN the widget SHALL support different stone patterns via CSS background-image overrides

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive interaction handling with all pointer and mouse events like Shudan, so that I can build responsive Go applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vertices are clicked THEN the widget SHALL emit onVertexClick events with vertex coordinates [x, y]
2. WHEN hover interactions occur THEN the widget SHALL support onVertexMouseEnter/Leave events for hover feedback
3. WHEN pointer events are used THEN the widget SHALL provide onVertexPointer* event handlers for touch devices
4. WHEN busy state is active THEN the widget SHALL disable all user interactions while preserving display
5. IF selected vertices are specified THEN the widget SHALL highlight them with visual selection indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible coordinate labeling system matching Shudan's approach, so that I can customize board coordinate display.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coordinates are enabled THEN the widget SHALL display labels using configurable coordX and coordY functions
2. WHEN custom coordinate systems are needed THEN the widget SHALL support alternative labeling schemes (numeric, alphabetic, custom)
3. WHEN showCoordinates is toggled THEN coordinate display SHALL update dynamically without full re-render
4. WHEN coordinate styling is applied THEN labels SHALL support custom fonts, sizes, and positioning
5. IF coordinate ranges change THEN labels SHALL update automatically to match visible board area

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced marker and annotation system inspired by Shudan's markerMap, so that I can display rich visual information on the board.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN markers are applied THEN the widget SHALL support markerMap with multiple marker types (circle, cross, triangle, square, point, loader, label)
2. WHEN label markers are used THEN the widget SHALL display text content with proper positioning and scaling
3. WHEN marker tooltips are needed THEN the widget SHALL support hover tooltip display using marker label property
4. WHEN multiple markers overlap THEN the widget SHALL handle z-index ordering and visual conflicts appropriately
5. IF custom marker types are defined THEN the widget SHALL support extensible marker rendering through CSS classes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ghost stone and heat/paint map capabilities like Shudan, so that I can create analysis and visualization features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ghost stones are displayed THEN the widget SHALL support ghostStoneMap with sign, type, and faint properties
2. WHEN analysis overlays are shown THEN the widget SHALL render paintMap with configurable opacity and colors
3. WHEN heat maps are applied THEN the widget SHALL support heatMap with strength values 0-9 and optional text labels
4. WHEN ghost stone types are used THEN the widget SHALL provide visual styling for 'good', 'interesting', 'doubtful', 'bad' types
5. IF paint regions are defined THEN the widget SHALL support directional painting (left, right, top, bottom, corners) for precise territory marking

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want line and arrow drawing capabilities matching Shudan's approach, so that I can highlight board relationships and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN lines are drawn THEN the widget SHALL support lines array with v1, v2 vertex coordinates and type specification
2. WHEN arrow indicators are needed THEN the widget SHALL render directional arrows between specified vertices
3. WHEN line styles are customized THEN the widget SHALL support different line types ('line', 'arrow') with CSS-based styling
4. WHEN multiple lines overlap THEN the widget SHALL handle layering and visual clarity appropriately
5. IF custom line types are defined THEN the widget SHALL support extensible line rendering through type-based CSS classes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want vertex state management including selection and dimming like Shudan, so that I can provide rich visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vertices are selected THEN the widget SHALL support selectedVertices array with visual highlighting
2. WHEN vertices are dimmed THEN the widget SHALL apply dimmedVertices with reduced opacity or alternative styling
3. WHEN selection states change THEN the widget SHALL update visual indicators efficiently without full re-render
4. WHEN directional selection is used THEN the widget SHALL support selectedLeft, selectedRight, selectedTop, selectedBottom for connecting selections
5. IF accessibility is important THEN the widget SHALL provide keyboard navigation support for selection changes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimization and efficient rendering, so that the board widget remains responsive with frequent updates like Shudan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signMap updates THEN the widget SHALL use differential rendering to update only changed vertices
2. WHEN animations are active THEN frame rates SHALL remain smooth with proper requestAnimationFrame usage
3. WHEN large boards are displayed THEN performance SHALL not degrade significantly through efficient DOM structure
4. WHEN multiple overlays exist THEN the widget SHALL use proper z-index layering and minimal DOM manipulation
5. IF memory optimization is needed THEN the widget SHALL clean up animation timers and prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive theming and customization API like Shudan, so that I can create branded and visually distinct Go interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling the widget THEN it SHALL support CSS custom properties for all visual elements (--shudan-* pattern equivalents)
2. WHEN custom assets are used THEN the widget SHALL support background-image overrides for board texture and stone images
3. WHEN random stone variation is desired THEN the widget SHALL apply random CSS classes (random_0 through random_4) for natural stone diversity
4. WHEN color schemes change THEN the widget SHALL support dynamic theme switching through CSS property updates
5. IF brand customization is needed THEN the widget SHALL provide extension points for custom rendering components

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples modeled after Shudan's approach, so that I can quickly implement sophisticated Go interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning the API THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL be available covering all props and configuration options
